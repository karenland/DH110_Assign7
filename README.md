<h2> Interactive Prototype: </h2>
I included a new task and also revamped the previous one I created interactions for.

**The old, revamped task:** Users are looking for book groups to join using the search icon or search bar.

**The new task:** users are going through the settings to change the language

**General updates to the interface I made:** increased font size, more buttons are being use and added the star rating to books on the results page.

**Future Plans and Thoughts:** As of right now, before the cognitive walkthrough, I do plan on changing the home screen to show updates from friends/authors/groups/etc. I plan on adding in text onto the taskbar. From research, older aged users prefer texts over icons so I plan on incorporating both. The text will at minimum be 12 pt and bolded. I was considering changing the color scheme since “blue” tends to help users relax and for the elderly, new technology can be daunting; however, it seems that colors within the blue-green spectrum are harder for them to distinguish so I am keeping the color scheme.
